HW-Week-1

This weeks project entailed refactoring code in both html and css files. The code was functional, but it needed to be made more clear and organized. The goal was to have the website still look nearly exactly as it did, but with a cleaner more accurate and consolidated set of html and css files.

The accessibility of the webpage needed to be altered, and allow for users that could possibly be impaired in some way to find the website more functional.

The difficulties I came across, was two fold: When I would attempt to consolidate some of the styling and it did not work, I would sometimes lose where I had started. At times I would then revert too far and find my webpage was an even bigger mess. I thankfully had two files going to help reset the file if I needed to just in case. 

Some things I enjoyed, and made sense to me were the semantic elements. It really helped me understand why certain code was where it was. Ina ddition it made styling far easier and eventually it helped sequence out the style sheet as well.
